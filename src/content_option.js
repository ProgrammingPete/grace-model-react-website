    aboutme: "Hello and Welcome (or welcome back!) My name is Grace Guandu and I am located in Northeast Ohio, frequenting the Cleveland and Akron-Canton (Kent) areas. I began pursuing modeling consistently during the beginning of 2023. I am currently working with Orlando, Florida-based mother agency, modelscout non-exclusively making me open to signing with other agencies. I am also an active member of the Casting Networks site. So far, I have walked for two Cleveland fashion shows, \"A Tale of Two Cities\" and \"The Culture.\" At this time I am open for paid bookings and time-for-print (TFP) collaborations. Please see the \"Contact Me\" tab for inquiries and updated information. Thank you and have a great day!",
